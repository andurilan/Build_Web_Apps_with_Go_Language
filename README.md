GREAT BOOKS:

While this book is the oldest of all of these, it is very approachable. Great for beginners!
Buy On Amazon ( http://amzn.to/1PmlKSB )

This book is also very approachable and great for beginners. Plus, it’s free!
Read it online for free ( www.golang-book.com )

Another great book. I’d categorize this one as intermediate. If you have some programming experience, this is a great book with which to begin. Chapter 2 is a bit advanced, as is chapter 7. Consider reading those two chapters last!

A fantastic book, very thorough, but more advanced. Purchase this with one of the other two books above so that you can get different perspectives on the same concept.
